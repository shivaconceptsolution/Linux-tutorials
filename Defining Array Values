Defining Array Values
The difference between an array variable and a scalar variable can be explained as follows.

Suppose you are trying to represent the names of various students as a set of variables. Each of the individual variables is a scalar variable as follows −

NAME01="Zara"
NAME02="Qadir"
NAME03="Mahnaz"
NAME04="Ayan"
NAME05="Daisy"
We can use a single array to store all the above mentioned names. Following is the simplest method of creating an array variable. This helps assign a value to one of its indices.

array_name[index]=value
Here array_name is the name of the array, index is the index of the item in the array that you want to set, and value is the value you want to set for that item.

As an example, the following commands −

NAME[0]="Zara"
NAME[1]="Qadir"
NAME[2]="Mahnaz"
NAME[3]="Ayan"
NAME[4]="Daisy"
If you are using the ksh shell, here is the syntax of array initialization −

set -A array_name value1 value2 ... valuen
If you are using the bash shell, here is the syntax of array initialization −

array_name=(value1 ... valuen)
Accessing Array Values
After you have set any array variable, you access it as follows −

${array_name[index]}
Here array_name is the name of the array, and index is the index of the value to be accessed. Following is an example to understand the concept −

Live Demo
#!/bin/sh

NAME[0]="Zara"
NAME[1]="Qadir"
NAME[2]="Mahnaz"
NAME[3]="Ayan"
NAME[4]="Daisy"
echo "First Index: ${NAME[0]}"
echo "Second Index: ${NAME[1]}"
The above example will generate the following result −

$./test.sh
First Index: Zara
Second Index: Qadir
You can access all the items in an array in one of the following ways −

${array_name[*]}
${array_name[@]}
Here array_name is the name of the array you are interested in. Following example will help you understand the concept −

Live Demo
#!/bin/sh

NAME[0]="Zara"
NAME[1]="Qadir"
NAME[2]="Mahnaz"
NAME[3]="Ayan"
NAME[4]="Daisy"
echo "First Method: ${NAME[*]}"
echo "Second Method: ${NAME[@]}"
The above example will generate the following result −

$./test.sh
First Method: Zara Qadir Mahnaz Ayan Daisy
Second Method: Zara Qadir Mahnaz Ayan Daisy
